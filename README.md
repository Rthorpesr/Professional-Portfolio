# Professional-Portfolio
Polished Website using paid theme.

I paided for a theme from ThemeForest. It was only $12.00, but well worth it. I now have a professional looking website.
The challenge was to morph my pictures, paragraphs, projects and navigate into the theme without breaking it. I broke it several times when trying to incorporate my information and have the page flow the way I wanted it to. Bootstrap, along with some other css files really took over this theme. I had to learn alot of the classes and understand what was going on it each of them.

After days struggling through this I am much wiser now than ever. I checked off every box in the "Homework Instructions" and believe I fullfilled each one. 

This website now has:
1.) a Polished Professional look

2.) I show at least 2 - 3 projects and you can link to the Github Repo and or Website to interactive with the project.

3.) I updated my LinkedIn page to include the Projects.

4.) I updated the Read me files for each of the chosen projectsand descripted the problem, how I solved it, and some 
    information about my technical approach.
    
5.) There is a link on the website that when clicked, takes you to a PDF of my Resume.

6.) The site is Employer Ready and Employer Competitive.

7.) The site is Tablet, and mobile responsive. ( it looks great on my cellphone). My family and friend love it!!

8.) The website is one page only now.

9.) I pinned three (3) projects in Github.

10.) My contact information is on the page.

11.) Readable with good sized fonts and colors that will not cause eye strains.
